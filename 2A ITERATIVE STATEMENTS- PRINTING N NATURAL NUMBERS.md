# Exp. No: 2a  
## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ Write a python program to compute the factorial for a Given Number
###  Aim
To write a Python program to compute the factorial of a given number using a while loop.

---

###  Algorithm
Start the program.
Input a number (num) from the user.
Assign f = num and n = f - 1.
Use a while loop:
While n > 0, multiply f = f * n.
Decrease n by 1 in each iteration.
After the loop, print the value of f.
End the program.

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```python
#Reg.NO:212223020020
#Name:Pradaksha V
num = int(input())
f=num
n=f-1
while n>0:
    f=f*n
    n=n-1
print(f"Factorial of the given number {num} is {f}")    

```
